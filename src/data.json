Even once I dared open it the general fanciness of the thing was too much, so I only made it a few pages in befores setting it down for a solid decade.  "

The effects didn't last terribly log, but it felt like snapping awake after a long grogginess."

On our last stop, in St. Peterburg, I managed to get my camera stolen, and so this is the only real record of that trip.  A mixture of the surreal and the specific, which feels appropriate to that period. "
